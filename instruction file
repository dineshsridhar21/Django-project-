Hi this Project is Implement API endpoints for an out-patient appointment system.
Doctors practice on a weekly schedule.
For simplicity, let's assume they practice on only one location, only on evenings, may consult X number of patients and always leave on Sundays.
API implementation is expected for doctors listing, doctor detail page and appointment booking.

Steps 1
* Install Python
* Install Flask
* Install Pymongo
* Install IDE

Step 2
* After installation connect the system environment

Step 3
* Create account on mongoDB atlas
* create new cluster
* Create client and collection

Step 4
* once you have been created
client = MongoClient('mongodb+srv://<username>:<password><cluster>.hgdvwnw.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority')

* set your username: password cluster

crreate database and replace with this in this "your_database_name"
db = client["your_database_name"]

create collection 2 and "doctors", "appointments"
doctors_collection = db["doctors"]
appointments_collection = db["appointments"]


->create doctor
->create an appointment
    in this process it check and books an available appointment timing.
